StatMerge log



Version 1.0.0   So merging of models is of serious consideration for distributed
                learning. My  Overkillintegrity  project is perfect for that but
                because I meant it for file preservation, people might have some
                trouble realizing OKI can  merge models and any files so here is
                OKI with different wording and no differences of function at all
                compared to OKI (Overkillintegrity.cpp.)
