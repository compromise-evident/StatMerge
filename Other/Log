StatMerge



Version 3.0.0   3 times faster.  Multiple in-streams  in dynamic array (vector).
                Complete rewrite, minimalist.  Merges bytes up to smallest file.
                Safety;  n files allowed,  empty files too.  Merges as previous.

Version 2.2.0   2 modes: merge based on Byte averages or Byte occurrences.

Version 2.1.1   Universal drag-n-drop; gets path then fixes it if drag-n-dropped
                regardless of single-quote presence & "enter" not being cleared,
                meaning you can have options before it where user presses enter.

Version 2.1.0   47% faster merging. Overkillintegrity now merged with StatMerge.
                When skipping  bytes that have  already been read,  it no longer
                reads them, but seeks to the wanted position or the  next unread
                byte, or whatever in_stream.seekg(bytes_to_skip, std::ios::beg);
                really does under the hoodie, where  bytes_to_skip  is quantity.
                (It's actually a suspicious itility;  there is probably metadata
                to be read about the file  lay-out  in order to move  read-head.
                See, it's presumably faster to seek from cur or current position
                hoverer, StatMerge cycles through files constantly,  so I'd have
                to have multi in_stream() unclosing to  gain speed not obvious.)
                File size-checking is ON by def (the section is still completely
                removable as usual.) Other improvements, small stuff,aesthetics.

Version 2.0.0   Checks file sizes by default before merging.

Version 1.0.0   So merging of models is of serious consideration for distributed
                learning. My  Overkillintegrity  project is perfect for that but
                because I meant it for file preservation, people might have some
                trouble realizing OKI can  merge models and any files so here is
                OKI with different wording and no differences of function at all
                compared to OKI (Overkillintegrity.cpp.)
